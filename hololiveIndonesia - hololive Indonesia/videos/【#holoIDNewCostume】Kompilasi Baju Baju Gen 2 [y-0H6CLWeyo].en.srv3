<p t="10084" d="1800" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Indonesia&#39;s birthday!​</p>
<p t="12954" d="3603" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Yes, this is the outfit for Indonesia&#39;s birthday.​</p>
<p t="16557" d="3303" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So today, we&#39;ve been—​</p>
<p t="19860" d="5906" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;ve been pre-ordering
the special set of clothes.​</p>
<p t="25766" d="6273" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">That we&#39;re going to wear to celebrate
Indonesia&#39;s birthday, you know?​</p>
<p t="32039" d="4004" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">We got the money from M-chan.​</p>
<p t="36043" d="3938" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And now that pre-order is done,
everything has been made,​</p>
<p t="39981" d="3635" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">we can pick it up at the mall.​</p>
<p t="45052" d="2635" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Excuse me, guys.
Just give me a moment, okay?​</p>
<p t="50358" d="2569" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;m wearing sandals!​</p>
<p t="52927" d="1635" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So, you guys can see my feet.​</p>
<p t="54562" d="6606" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And these pants,
they&#39;re white—mostly white​</p>
<p t="61168" d="4772" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">with some gold details.​</p>
<p t="65940" d="2903" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">My outfit has batik pattern,​</p>
<p t="68843" d="3270" wp="1" ws="1"><s p="1">and this is called ​</s><s>​</s><s p="2">batik kipas​</s><s p="1">.​</s></p>
<p t="72113" d="5906" wp="1" ws="1"><s p="1">So, ​</s><s>​</s><s p="2">batik kipas​</s><s p="1"> is a batik pattern​
​that has been used in the past by the nobles.​</s></p>
<p t="78019" d="5572" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Because it represents nobility
and is worn by the royal family.​</p>
<p t="83591" d="4137" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But now, civilians can wear it.​</p>
<p t="87728" d="6307" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Also, it represents beauty and flexibility.​</p>
<p t="94035" d="2602" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Many traditional dances costumes
used this kind of batik pattern.​</p>
<p t="96637" d="3670" wp="1" ws="1"><s p="1">And most importantly, it&#39;s worn by ​</s><s>​</s><s p="2">me​</s><s p="1">!​</s></p>
<p t="100307" d="5506" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">If you see at the top part of my shirt,​</p>
<p t="105813" d="2769" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">so it&#39;s a lacy pattern.​</p>
<p t="108582" d="3737" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But if you see at the side,​</p>
<p t="112319" d="4171" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">you can see a little hand fan form​</p>
<p t="116490" d="2903" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">and also like the tail of a peacock.​</p>
<p t="119393" d="4538" wp="1" ws="1"><s p="1">Speaking of which,​
​if you see my ​</s><s>​</s><s p="2">batik kipas​</s><s p="1"> shawl,​</s></p>
<p t="123931" d="7007" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">you can also see the peacock&#39;s feather.
and also the silhouette of a peacock.​</p>
<p t="130938" d="3470" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Yeah, just for that little
flavour of identity.​</p>
<p t="134408" d="1434" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This is mine!​</p>
<p t="137244" d="4071" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Do you like the earrings?
I hope you like the earrings.​</p>
<p t="141315" d="2669" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I hope you like the earrings.​</p>
<p t="143984" d="2403" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Because if you notice,​</p>
<p t="146387" d="4538" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">the large one is actually on this side
instead of this one.​</p>
<p t="150925" d="5305" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Because my usual outfit is on this side
instead of this side.​</p>
<p t="156230" d="2736" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And also the tiny hairpin,​</p>
<p t="158966" d="5172" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">the hairpin size is getting smaller.​</p>
<p t="164138" d="7708" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Yeah. And then,
my fingernails are same as my toenails.​</p>
<p t="171846" d="4638" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">They&#39;re emerald,
the same colour as my eyes.​</p>
<p t="176484" d="8074" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">If you see my bracelet
on my right arm—my right wrist,​</p>
<p t="184558" d="7773" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">it&#39;s one of the Indonesian handcraft
bracelet souvenirs.​</p>
<p t="193868" d="2602" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So, it&#39;s different from the usual outfit.​</p>
<p t="196470" d="2736" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It&#39;s more casual.​</p>
<p t="199206" d="5806" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So if you want to have some traditional elements,
the clothes don&#39;t need to be formal.​</p>
<p t="205012" d="2836" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Just like this, with your own personality,​</p>
<p t="207848" d="4571" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">you can wear whatever you want
and be like me.​</p>
<p t="212419" d="3170" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So there&#39;s a little touch of
Indonesian flavour.​</p>
<p t="215589" d="3970" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But the clothes can also be worn casually.​</p>
<p t="220628" d="3870" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Okay, guys! Bye bye!
It&#39;s Anya time!​</p>
<p t="224498" d="2468" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">See ya!​</p>
<p t="230971" d="1869" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Where&#39;s Anya?​</p>
<p t="232840" d="3102" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">I&#39;m still preparing.​</p>
<p t="236744" d="3336" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Where&#39;s my clothes?​</p>
<p t="240080" d="4605" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">By the way, I think you guys
found out the answer to​</p>
<p t="244685" d="3470" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">&quot;Will Anya go barefoot again?&quot;​</p>
<p t="248155" d="4870" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">So, did you win or lose the bet?​</p>
<p t="254028" d="3470" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">I&#39;m wearing something, by the way.​</p>
<p t="257498" d="3603" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">That&#39;s just not my feet.
Other than the shoes,​</p>
<p t="261101" d="4371" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">I&#39;m also wearing something.
Do you guys know what?​</p>
<p t="265472" d="2436" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Do you guys know what is it?​</p>
<p t="267908" d="2902" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Also, you guys can see the clothes already.
But...​</p>
<p t="273647" d="4437" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">That&#39;s a skirt.
I&#39;m wearing a skirt.​</p>
<p t="279153" d="3403" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">What kind of tie is that?​</p>
<p t="282556" d="2536" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">You must have figured out the pattern.​</p>
<p t="285092" d="3335" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">That&#39;s a batik pattern.​</p>
<p t="289597" d="3603" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">It&#39;s here! My new clothes!​</p>
<p t="293200" d="4204" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">This is how my new clothes look like.​</p>
<p t="297404" d="4705" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Not really a detective look, this is just
a normal glasses and trench coat.​</p>
<p t="302109" d="1901" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">And stuff...​</p>
<p t="304612" d="4437" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">This is the look without coat.​</p>
<p t="309049" d="1702" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Thank you.​</p>
<p t="310751" d="4471" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">And if you look at the skirt,
there&#39;s a beautiful batik pattern.​</p>
<p t="315222" d="2736" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Thank you, Mama!​</p>
<p t="317958" d="9743" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">So, I also helped Mama about the design.​</p>
<p t="327701" d="3737" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">This is how I look without glasses.​</p>
<p t="331438" d="3904" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">This is the no-glasses look.
I want to know which one looks better.​</p>
<p t="335342" d="4271" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Yeah, I personally like
the glasses look better myself.​</p>
<p t="339613" d="4238" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Because it&#39;s something new.
I don&#39;t have that normally.​</p>
<p t="343851" d="3403" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">This is not even my final form, by the way.​</p>
<p t="347254" d="3569" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Will it come someday?
Hmm, I wonder.​</p>
<p t="352993" d="3170" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">So, it looks like this.​</p>
<p t="356163" d="7541" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Usually, my appearance is a cute one
with twin-tail hair.​</p>
<p t="363704" d="8508" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">But for this time,
I want to look more mature.​</p>
<p t="372212" d="4138" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">You guys want to see
the no-coat version as well?​</p>
<p t="376350" d="5270" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Just so that you guys can see
the batik pattern and everything.​</p>
<p t="382656" d="2703" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Yeah, I think I look more mature at least.​</p>
<p t="385359" d="3569" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Because that&#39;s the image
that I&#39;m trying to go this time.​</p>
<p t="389797" d="4469" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">So, this is Anya&#39;s new outfit.
So, did you win or lose the bet?​</p>
<p t="395002" d="3970" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Thank you for coming.
I&#39;ll be taking my leave.​</p>
<p t="398972" d="2536" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">And don&#39;t forget to move to Ollie&#39;s stream.​</p>
<p t="401508" d="2136" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Go move, everyone. Go leave.​</p>
<p t="403644" d="1168" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Go leave!​</p>
<p t="404812" d="3336" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Go and move to Ollie&#39;s stream.​</p>
<p t="408148" d="1335" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Thank you so much.​</p>
<p t="409483" d="2167" wp="1" ws="1" p="3">Alright then, bye bye!​</p>
<p t="416056" d="7875" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s a pair of shoes!​</p>
<p t="423931" d="5906" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">I have tassels here too.​</p>
<p t="429837" d="3303" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">&quot;What is it for?&quot;
For sweeping. (lol)​</p>
<p t="433140" d="2903" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">No! No, it&#39;s just to make it look cuter.​</p>
<p t="436043" d="1433" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Look, look!​</p>
<p t="438178" d="3137" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s Udin!​</p>
<p t="441315" d="3370" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">There&#39;s Udin!​</p>
<p t="444685" d="3470" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">On my right foot,
this is the Ollie&#39;s special bandage.​</p>
<p t="448155" d="2636" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">So my foot don&#39;t come off.​</p>
<p t="450791" d="2469" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Don&#39;t my thighs pretty shiny? Look.​</p>
<p t="453260" d="2836" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">You guys have to look closely.​</p>
<p t="456096" d="4603" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s pretty plump too, like—I don&#39;t know
about you guys, but I&#39;d take a bat of that.​</p>
<p t="461368" d="4571" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Mama Mia!
Look, it&#39;s a batik skirt!​</p>
<p t="465939" d="4670" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Batik is a pattern that we created
by dye resisting wax.​</p>
<p t="471378" d="3203" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Of course, there are different methods
on how to make batik,​</p>
<p t="474581" d="2469" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">depending on each Indonesia region.​</p>
<p t="477050" d="2570" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">That&#39;s the very definition of batik.​</p>
<p t="479620" d="5572" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">This is the geometric batik pattern.​</p>
<p t="485192" d="3770" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">This batik is inspired by—not made by,​</p>
<p t="488962" d="5406" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">but it&#39;s inspired by Pilin&#39;s batik pattern.
Or well-known as Padang&#39;s batik pattern.​</p>
<p t="494368" d="6239" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">This batik represents the spirit to stay alive
and not easily give up when facing problems.​</p>
<p t="500607" d="2736" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">I have a corset.​</p>
<p t="503343" d="5239" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s inspired by Ramayana ballet
and Gatotkaca outfit.​</p>
<p t="508582" d="1368" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">What is this?​</p>
<p t="509950" d="2970" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Yeah, this is the point that I love
the most about the clothes.​</p>
<p t="512920" d="3003" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">So, LAM-mama added some black laces.​</p>
<p t="515923" d="4104" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">So, Mama and I have the same fashion taste
and we love the gothic emo-ish punk look.​</p>
<p t="520027" d="2769" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">So LAM-mama added these.
Thank you so much.​</p>
<p t="522796" d="5239" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s a little modern fusion that LAM-mama
added because we like fashions.​</p>
<p t="528035" d="4604" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">I don&#39;t know where exactly it came from,
but this design appears in several areas.​</p>
<p t="532639" d="2837" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">For now,
I&#39;ll translate the meaning from Java.​</p>
<p t="535476" d="5972" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">This necklace depicts three stages of
a woman&#39;s life: birth, marriage, and death.​</p>
<p t="541448" d="2202" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Usually, this necklace is worn by the bride.​</p>
<p t="543650" d="4972" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">This is Cunduk Mentul.​</p>
<p t="548622" d="3203" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It usually attached to
the bride&#39;s hair-bun and shook.​</p>
<p t="551825" d="4104" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">It&#39;s always in odd number
and each number has its own meaning.​</p>
<p t="555929" d="4104" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">I have seven Cunduk Mentul
that represents assistance.​</p>
<p t="560033" d="7708" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">The bride usually wear this, so they can
always get help in their marriage life.​</p>
<p t="567741" d="4104" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">But I wear this so I can
get protection in my life.​</p>
<p t="571845" d="3604" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">To be exact, a protection when I play Apex.​</p>
<p t="575449" d="2869" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">My theme is &quot;Nusantara&#39;s Princess&quot;.​</p>
<p t="578318" d="2802" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Because these accessories are
from various regions.​</p>
<p t="581822" d="2301" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Maybe it was full of accessories, huh?​</p>
<p t="584691" d="1133" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Ta-da!​</p>
<p t="586760" d="2736" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">I can do this too. Look.​</p>
<p t="589496" d="3937" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Thank you for coming, everyone.​</p>
<p t="593433" d="4672" wp="1" ws="1" p="4">Thank you for coming to our relay of
