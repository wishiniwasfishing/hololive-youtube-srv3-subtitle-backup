They&#39;re practically the same person.​</p>
<p t="5513" d="2969" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">They&#39;re practically clones of each other.
They&#39;re like twins.​</p>
<p t="8482" d="3537" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;3u&quot; is basically bigger than &quot;i&quot;.​</p>

<p t="16624" d="1433" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Okay, next.​</p>
<p t="19927" d="3070" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Of course! Of course, that—​</p>
<p t="22997" d="1868" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Of course, this one is going to go out.​</p>
<p t="24865" d="2535" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This is the simple play in the book.​</p>
<p t="28369" d="1168" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Very simple.​</p>
<p t="29537" d="1968" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">A very simple play in the book.​</p>
<p t="31505" d="2636" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;m sure everyone already knows
the answer by now.​</p>
<p t="34141" d="1934" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Let&#39;s do it anyways.​</p>
<p t="36844" d="11678" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;9x-7i&quot; is bigger than &quot;3(3x-7u)&quot;.​</p>
<p t="48522" d="2002" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;m going to speedrun this one, okay?​</p>
<p t="50524" d="5239" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So basically,
this is &quot;9x-7i&quot; that we&#39;re going to like...​</p>
<p t="55763" d="3170" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;m going to do a whole house for here. ​</p>
<p t="58933" d="2235" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So this is going to be &quot;9x&#39;&quot;,​</p>
<p t="61168" d="3003" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">because &quot;3&quot; multiplied by &quot;3x&quot;​</p>
<p t="64171" d="6073" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">and also &quot;3&quot; multiplied by &quot;-7u&quot;
becomes &quot;-21u&quot;.​</p>
<p t="70244" d="1368" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">That&#39;s a lot of &quot;u&quot;s.​</p>
<p t="71612" d="1869" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And then,
what we&#39;re going to do is that—​</p>
<p t="73481" d="2502" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">You see these &quot;9x&quot;s?​</p>
<p t="75983" d="4304" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Do you see these &quot;9x&quot;s?
They&#39;re practically the same person.​</p>
<p t="80287" d="3170" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">They&#39;re practically clones of each other.
They&#39;re like twins.​</p>
<p t="83457" d="3504" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So, twins are basically a pair.​</p>
<p t="86961" d="7340" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So we&#39;re going to make them a pair,
we&#39;re going to get them off our equation.​</p>
<p t="94301" d="4405" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And then, we&#39;re going to be left
with &quot;-7i&quot; with &quot;-21u&quot;.​</p>
<p t="98706" d="3603" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And then, we just divide them with &quot;-3&quot;.​</p>
<p t="102309" d="2770" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And when we divide them with &quot;-3&quot;,​</p>
<p t="105079" d="2868" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">that means &quot;i&quot; is like the only—​</p>
<p t="108549" d="2635" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;i&quot; is basically just one.​</p>
<p t="111986" d="3435" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And then, this is going to be &quot;3u&quot;.​</p>
<p t="116190" d="4238" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So, &quot;3u&quot; is basically bigger than &quot;i&quot;.​</p>
<p t="120428" d="2467" wp="1" ws="1"><s p="1">So, it&#39;s ​</s><s>​</s><s p="2">I love you​</s><s p="1">.​</s></p>
<p t="127501" d="3703" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Oh yeah, divided by &quot;-7&quot;, not &quot;-3&quot;.
I&#39;m sorry.​</p>
<p t="132673" d="2735" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Divided by &quot;-7&quot;, not &quot;-3&quot;.​</p>
<p t="137711" d="4337" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Easy peasy lemon squeezy, right?​</p>
<p t="143250" d="3170" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Smooth. Damn that was smooth.​</p>
<p t="146420" d="2401" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Oldest trick in the book.​</p>
