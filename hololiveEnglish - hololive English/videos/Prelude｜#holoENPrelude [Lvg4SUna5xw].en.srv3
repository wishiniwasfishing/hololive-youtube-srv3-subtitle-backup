<p t="11110" d="2720">On the day I descended and had awakened,</p>
<p t="17270" d="3780">“The Gods” had only just begun the world’s construction,</p>
<p t="21050" d="3180">and the shaping of “Concepts” had just started.</p>
<p t="29120" d="3860">In the beginning, “The Gods” created “Space.”</p>
<p t="33440" d="4890">However, “Space” is nothing but textures and principles.</p>
<p t="38330" d="2130">Nothing more than disorder.</p>
<p t="43660" d="4910">Thus, “The Gods” created “Nature” to bind together the textures.</p>
<p t="51560" d="4150">Alas, “Nature” was merely but an existence.</p>
<p t="61840" d="4520">Hence, “The Gods” poured in “Time,” to orchestrate their growth.</p>
<p t="69620" d="4250">With the support of “Time,” lifeforms achieved evolution.</p>
<p t="77460" d="5400">Lifeforms begged for power, and “The Gods” bestowed knowledge to them.</p>
<p t="94890" d="3840">Scilicet, “Civilization” was formed.</p>
