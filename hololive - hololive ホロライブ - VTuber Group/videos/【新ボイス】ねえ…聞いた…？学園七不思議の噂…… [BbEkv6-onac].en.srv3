<p t="15522" d="8200">So, like, all I&#39;ve heard since coming back to school
were rumors about the Seven Wonders. </p>
<p t="24400" d="1325">The Seven Wonders?! </p>
<p t="26189" d="3101">Y&#39;know, what everyone&#39;s been talking about...?</p>
<p t="29628" d="3532">The Immortal Student, the Living Statue, the Forgotten Day, the Warped Bell, the Shared Dream, the Unopening Door...</p>
<p t="33160" d="2000">I&#39;m talking about the Isolated Town.</p>
<p t="35727" d="6930">Oh, I dug a little into this — the thing where people lose their souls to their doppelgängers, right? </p>
<p t="43592" d="1900">What? No!</p>
<p t="46488" d="7356">What if all of the other wonders were hoaxes and what we&#39;re investigating are the real ones?</p>
